there will be a client and server.
the server will send bg and fg updates to the client for its area.ce
the server also sends the time to the client frequently.
an fg object is defined by position, time and parameters.
therefore when received by the client the fg object will be somewhat advanced along its path.
there are two types of trans fg object. local and server.
server trans fg objects are sent to the sever and only rendered when received back. this way you get the same information as everyone else.
local trans objects are for effects only.
